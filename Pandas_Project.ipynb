    "Your goal in this part of the assignment is to examine the methodology of these rankings and attempt to recreate it with the scorecard data. Your process should be well justified and presented through the use of markdowns. You don't need to recreate the methodology exactly, especially considering there may be criteria being used that you don't have access to. I would choose, at minimum, the top 5 highly-weighted criteria in the methodology and build your recreation from those."

    "TAMU is ranked 38 out of 1492, which makes it in the top 2% of colleges for my lists. Moving from the city to College Station was a huge difference but it was an intresting time none the less. The school does lack demographic diversity (https://accountability.tamu.edu/All-Metrics/Mixed-Metrics/Student-Demographics) but for the most part everyone was welcoming. The resources were great. There is a website (https://www.applytexas.org/) that allows you to apply to colleges within Texas application free. You are able to travel to Houston, Austin, Dallas, San Antino and other diverse cities. Colorado is a cheap flight away. More people from California were and are moving there which makes it more expensive but more city people friendly. Currently I have a friend that is teaching there and a old work colleuge that graduated from its MD program\n",

    "The school was a military school and still holds some of the traditions til this day. They are welcoming to everyone regardless of background. The school has a great veteran and military network that makes things accessible to everyone. The only problem is the poitical climate of the state government but that is appearent in most states. "
